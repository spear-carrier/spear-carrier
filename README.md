# I'm Matt

### I borrowed the username "spear-carrier" from reading Colonel Andrew Bacevich, Ret. because it seemed like a good reminder to not always act as if I'm the main character.

Bacevitch wrote: "After twenty-three years spent inside the U.S. Army seemingly going somewhere, I now found myself on the outside going nowhere in particular. In the self-contained and cloistered universe of regimental life, I had briefly risen to the status of minor spear carrier. The instant I took off my uniform, that status vanished. I soon came to a proper appreciation of my own insignificance, a salutary lesson that I ought to have absorbed many years earlier."

### I'm a recent graduate of the Harris School of Public Policy at The University of Chicago. 

### I have 12 years of experience working in military operations, intelligence, commercial cybersecurity project management, and SaaS customer success. 

## I'm currently looking for a professional opportunities that use communications, data analysis, and policy analysis to protect people and strengthen civic life.
